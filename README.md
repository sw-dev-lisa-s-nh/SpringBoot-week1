# SpringBoot-week1
BESD Coding Bootcamp Spring Boot Week 1s

Our assignment this week was to work through a 
Social Media API Tutorial, where we created a 
Maven Project, added parent and dependencies to
the pom.xml file, added an application.properties
file, and then created the following files:
	* controllers:  Comment, Post & User
	* entities:  Comment, Post & User
	* repositories:  Comment, Post & User
	* services:  Comment, Post & User
	* views:  Following
	
It was a great exercise to work through this
tutorial, which built the application level by 
level explaining each step along the way.

My favorite part of this coding assignment was
troubleshooting and debugging to end up with a 
working program in the end!
